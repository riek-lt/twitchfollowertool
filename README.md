# twitchfollowertool
Tool to compare follower lists to see who followed/unfollowed you. This tool uses the [Unfollower tool](https://twitch-tools.rootonline.de/followerlist_viewer.php) made by [@CommanderRoot](https://twitter.com/CommanderRoot) to analyze a streamer's follower list, and check for changes.

## Why was this made?
I have been getrting a lot of unwanted follow bots on my stream, at time of writing about 15% of followers are said followbots. I wanted a way to track these seeing how many would follow, and if/when they would unfollow.
I am aware that honest followers/unfollowers are also tracker, but it is up to the user to do with this data whatever they please.
